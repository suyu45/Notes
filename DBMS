✅ What is Normalization?
Normalization is a process in database design used to remove redundancy (duplicate data) and avoid anomalies during: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

It organizes data into multiple related tables so the database becomes:
✔ Efficient
✔ Consistent
✔ Easy to maintain

Goal:
👉 Store each fact only once
👉 Avoid unnecessary duplication
👉 Make relationships clear

🎯 Why Normalization is Needed?
Without normalization (in unnormalized form):
| StudentID | StudentName | Course1 | Course2 | Instructor |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1         | Suyog       | DBMS    | SQL     | Mehta      |

Problems:
- Redundancy (same instructor repeated for many rows)
- Update anomaly => If instructor name changes, need to update in many places.
- Insert anomaly => Cannot add a course without a student.
- Delete anomaly => Deleting last student deletes course details too.
Normalization fixes this.

🔥 Types (Normal Forms)
1️⃣ 1NF (First Normal Form)
Rule:
✔ No repeating groups
✔ Every column must have atomic (indivisible) values
✔ Each row must be unique

❌ Before 1NF:
| Student | Courses   |
| ------- | --------- |
| Suyog   | DBMS, SQL |

✔ After 1NF:
| Student | Course |
| ------- | ------ |
| Suyog   | DBMS   |
| Suyog   | SQL    |


2️⃣ 2NF (Second Normal Form)
Rule:
✔ Must be in 1NF
✔ No partial dependency
(A non-key column should not depend on only part of a composite key)

Example:
Table (StudentID, CourseID) → Composite key
| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |

Problem:
StudentName depends only on StudentID, not CourseID → partial dependency.

✔ Fix by splitting:

Students Table
| StudentID | StudentName |

Enrollments Table
| StudentID | CourseID |


3️⃣ 3NF (Third Normal Form)
Rule:
✔ Must be in 2NF
✔ No transitive dependency
(Non-key attribute should not depend on another non-key attribute)

❌ Example:
| EmpID | EmpName | DeptID | DeptName |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | -------- |

DeptName depends on DeptID → transitive dependency.

✔ Fix:

Employee
| EmpID | EmpName | DeptID |

Department
| DeptID | DeptName |


4️⃣ BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
A stronger version of 3NF.

Rule:
✔ Every determinant must be a candidate key

Used when:
Table has multiple candidate keys
Functional dependencies become complex

🌟 Summary Table
| Normal Form | Removes               | Requirement       |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| **1NF**     | Repeating groups      | Atomic values     |
| **2NF**     | Partial dependency    | Must be in 1NF    |
| **3NF**     | Transitive dependency | Must be in 2NF    |
| **BCNF**    | Advanced anomalies    | Stronger than 3NF |


📘 Real Example of Full Normalization
Student Course Table (Unnormalized)
| StudentID | StudentName | Course | Instructor |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |

After Normalization:
Students
| StudentID | StudentName |

Courses
| CourseID | CourseName | Instructor |

StudentCourse
| StudentID | CourseID |

🎯 Benefits of Normalization
✔ Eliminates duplicate data
✔ Avoids update/insert/delete anomalies
✔ Makes database efficient
✔ Improves data consistency
✔ Saves storage

📌 Interview Answer (Short Version)
Normalization is a database design technique used to remove redundancy and avoid anomalies by organizing data into multiple related tables. 
It follows several normal forms like 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF. Each form reduces a specific type of redundancy (repeating groups, partial dependency, transitive dependency).

✅ What Are Anomalies in DBMS?
Anomalies are problems that occur in a database when it is poorly designed (not normalized).
They cause data inconsistency, redundancy, and incorrect behavior during: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

Normalization helps remove these anomalies.

⭐ Types of Anomalies
There are 3 main anomalies:

1️⃣ Update Anomaly
Occurs when the same data exists in multiple places.
If you update one place, you must update all places.
If not, data becomes inconsistent.

❌ Example (Unnormalized Table)
| StudentID | StudentName | Course | Instructor |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1         | Suyog       | DBMS   | Mehta      |
| 2         | Rohan       | SQL    | Mehta      |

Instructor "Mehta" repeated twice.

Problem
If instructor name changes to “Mehta Sir”, YOU MUST update both rows.
If you forget one → inconsistent data.

👉 This is Update Anomaly.



2️⃣ Insert Anomaly
Occurs when you cannot insert data because some other data is missing.

❌ Example
You want to add a new course "AI" with instructor "Kapoor".
But your table structure is:

| StudentID | StudentName | Course | Instructor |

You cannot insert a course until a student registers for it.

👉 This is Insert Anomaly.



3️⃣ Delete Anomaly
Occurs when deleting one record unintentionally removes other important data.

❌ Example
| StudentID | StudentName | Course | Instructor |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1         | Suyog       | DBMS   | Mehta      |

If you delete Suyog (the only student in DBMS),
then DBMS + Instructor Mehta data also gets deleted.

So deleting one fact removes another fact.

👉 This is Delete Anomaly.


🧠 Summary Table
Anomaly Type	When it Occurs	Problem
Update	Same data stored multiple times	Data inconsistency
Insert	Cannot insert data without other data	Missing information
Delete	Deleting a record removes needed data	Loss of information


🎯 Why Anomalies Occur?
Because table is poorly structured:
Repeating groups
Redundant data
Dependencies not organized
Not normalized

Thus, database becomes inconsistent.


🔥 How to Remove Anomalies?

Apply Normalization:
1NF → Remove repeating groups
2NF → Remove partial dependency
3NF → Remove transitive dependency
BCNF → Solve advanced anomalies


📌 Interview Answer (Short & Crisp)

Anomalies are problems in database operations caused by un-normalized tables. The three main anomalies are:
Update anomaly – updating data in one place but not in others leads to inconsistency.
Insert anomaly – cannot insert a record because some required data is missing.
Delete anomaly – deleting a record unintentionally deletes important information.

Normalization helps eliminate these anomalies.
