1. What is SQL?
=> • SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is used for storing and managing data in Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
   • It is a standard language for Relational Database System. It enables a user to create, read, update and delete relational databases and tables.
   • All the RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.
   • SQL allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements.
   • Using the SQL statements, you can perform most of the actions in a database.


SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to store, manage, and retrieve data from relational databases.
It is used to:
- Create databases and tables
- Insert, update, delete records
- Query data => fetch data
- Control permissions
- Maintain data integrity

SQL works on relational databases, where data is stored in tables (rows + columns).

📌 Why is SQL needed?
Imagine you have millions of customer records.
You cannot search manually — you need a language to interact with the database.
SQL acts as a communication language between the user/program and the database.
📌 Example : Query: Fetch customers from Pune

📌 Key Features of SQL
1️⃣ Easy to Learn and Use : SQL uses simple English-like syntax.

2️⃣ Faster Query Processing
SQL is optimized for:
Searching, Filtering, Inserting, Updating, Deleting, Aggregating large records
Example: Retrieving 10,000 student records with conditions is almost instant.

4️⃣ Supports Large Databases
SQL can handle huge volumes of data (millions of rows) efficiently.
Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and banks rely on SQL databases because of scalability.

5️⃣ Supports Multiple Operations
SQL supports all the essential operations for data management:
1) DDL (Create/Alter structure)
2) DML (Insert/Update/Delete data)
3) DQL (Fetch data)
4) DCL (Security/Permissions)
5) TCL (Transactions)
This makes SQL a complete data management language.

6️⃣ High Security
SQL helps control database access using permissions.
Example: ****** GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO user1; ****** Query *********
Only the allowed user can access specific tables.

7️⃣ Supports ACID Properties (Reliability)
SQL databases guarantee:
- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability
This ensures reliable and correct transactions, which is critical in banking, finance, healthcare, etc.

8️⃣ Integration With Programming Languages
SQL works easily with: Java (JDBC), Python (MySQL connector, SQLAlchemy), PHP, C#, Node.js
This makes it ideal for full-stack development.

9️⃣ Portable Language
SQL works on: PCs, Laptops, Servers, Cloud platforms (AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GCP SQL)
You can move databases from one environment to another easily.

🔟 Multi-User Support
Many users can access and modify the database at the same time using concurrency control systems.
Example: 1000 users booking tickets → SQL handles all transactions safely.

1️⃣1️⃣ Powerful Data Analysis & Reporting
SQL supports functions like: SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOINS, SUBQUERIES
These help in analytics, reporting, and decision-making.

🎯 Interview Summary (Short Answer)
SQL is easy to learn, highly secure, fast, reliable, standardized, scalable, supports transactions, integrates well with applications, and can handle large volumes of data efficiently.





📌 SQL vs MySQL (Tabular Difference)

🔧 Example to Understand the Difference
SQL Example (Language): SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE city = 'Pune';
This is SQL — the instruction.

MySQL Example (Database executing it)
You run the above query inside MySQL Workbench, and MySQL returns the result:
| id | name  | city |
| -- | ----- | ---- |
| 3  | Suyog | Pune |

MySQL is executing the SQL query.

📌 Key Differences in Simple Words
SQL = Grammar (language)
MySQL = Book written using that grammar (database software)

OR

SQL = What to do
MySQL = Where it is done

🎯 Interview Short Answer
SQL is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases.
MySQL is a relational database management system that uses SQL to store, retrieve, and manage data.



⭐ SQL vs NoSQL (Tabular Difference)
| Feature            | SQL                                          | NoSQL                                                    |

⭐ Examples
SQL Example (Relational) : SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE amount > 1000;
Data is stored in structured tables.

NoSQL Example (MongoDB Document)
{
  "name": "Suyog",
  "city": "Pune",
  "skills": ["C++", "SQL", "Node.js"]
}
This is stored in a flexible JSON-like document.


⭐ When to Use SQL?
Use SQL when:
✔ Data is structured
✔ Relationships are important
✔ Strong consistency is needed
✔ Operations require complex queries & joins
✔ You need ACID transactions
Examples: Banking systems, E-commerce orders/payments, Inventory systems, Enterprise backend apps

⭐ When to Use NoSQL?
Use NoSQL when:
✔ Data is unstructured or semi-structured
✔ High-speed read/write is required
✔ You need to scale horizontally
✔ Schema changes frequently
✔ Big data or real-time data processing
Examples: Social media platforms, Chat applications, Recommendation systems, IoT sensor data, Logging systems

⭐ Short Interview Summary
SQL is relational, structured, schema-based, and good for consistency.
NoSQL is non-relational, schema-less, scalable, and good for big data and real-time apps.



⭐ What are SQL Data Types?
SQL Data Types define what kind of value can be stored in a column of a table—such as:
1️⃣ Numeric Data Types
2️⃣ String / Character Data Types
3️⃣ Date & Time Data Types
4️⃣ Boolean Data Type
5️⃣ Binary Data Types
6️⃣ Special Types (ENUM, SET, JSON)

eg. salary DECIMAL(10, 2)  -- Max 10 digits, 2 after decimal

CHAR(n) =>	Fixed-length text (Faster) eg. gender CHAR(1)
VARCHAR(n)	=> Variable-length text (Most used)  eg. name VARCHAR(50)

✔ Use CHAR for fixed values like gender ('M', 'F')
✔ Use VARCHAR for names, emails, addresses


🏷️ 6. Special Data Types (MySQL)
ENUM: Stores a fixed list of values.
      eg. status ENUM('active','inactive','blocked')

🎯 Interview Short Answer
SQL data types define the kind of data a column holds, such as numeric, string, date/time, boolean, and binary types, ensuring proper storage and efficient processing.




⭐ CHAR vs VARCHAR (Very Important DBMS/SQL Interview Topic)
Both CHAR and VARCHAR are string data types, but they store data differently.

🔹 1️⃣ CHAR (Fixed-length String) => CHAR stores fixed-length data.

If you define: CHAR(10)
This column will always take 10 characters of storage.
If the input is shorter, SQL will pad it with spaces.

Example:
Value = 'ABC'
Stored as = 'ABC ' (7 trailing spaces)

✔ Fast for fixed-size data
✔ Efficient for small, predictable values
✔ No change in length → faster comparisons


🔹 2️⃣ VARCHAR (Variable-length String) => VARCHAR stores variable-length data.

If you define: VARCHAR(10)
It stores only the actual number of characters, plus 1 or 2 bytes to store length metadata.

Example:
Value = 'ABC'
Storage = 3 chars + 1 byte = 4 bytes

✔ Saves space
✔ Best when length varies
✔ Commonly used for names, emails, addresses

⭐ CHAR vs VARCHAR (Tabular Difference)
| Feature          | CHAR                             | VARCHAR                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Storage**      | Fixed-length                     | Variable-length            |
| **Speed**        | Faster                           | Slightly slower            |
| **Performance**  | Best for fixed-size data         | Best when data varies      |
| **Padding**      | Pads with spaces                 | No padding                 |
| **Use Case**     | Codes, gender, OTP, country_code | Names, emails, addresses   |
| **Memory Usage** | Always uses full size            | Uses only required memory  |

🎯 Short Interview Answer
CHAR is used for fixed-length strings and is faster but wastes space.
VARCHAR is used for variable-length strings and saves space but is slightly slower.


******************************************************************************************************************************

⭐ What is DDL?
DDL (Data Definition Language) is a set of SQL commands used to define, modify, or delete the structure of database objects such as: Tables, Views, Indexes, Schemas, Constraints
DDL changes the schema of the database.
✔ Structure-level changes
✔ Auto-committed (cannot be rolled back in many systems)

⭐ Main DDL Commands
CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME

🔹 1️⃣ CREATE — Create new database objects => Used to create a table, database, view, or index.
Example: Create a database => CREATE DATABASE companyDB;

🔹 2️⃣ ALTER — Modify the structure of an existing table
Used to:
✔ Add a column
✔ Delete a column
✔ Modify a column (change datatype, size, constraints)
✔ Add/remove constraints => same syntax as Modify a column
✔ Change Column Name (Rename Column) only in MySQL
✔ Rename a table

Example: Add a column
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);

Example: Modify a column
ALTER TABLE Employees
MODIFY salary DECIMAL(12,2);

Example: Drop a column
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP COLUMN email;

Example: Change Column Name (Rename Column)  only in MySql
ALTER TABLE Employees
CHANGE name full_name VARCHAR(60);

Add a Constraint => Example: Add NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE Employees
MODIFY name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;

Rename a Table
ALTER TABLE old_table
RENAME TO new_table;

🔹 3️⃣ DROP — Delete database objects permanently => This removes the table and all its data.
DROP TABLE Employees;
DROP DATABASE companyDB;
⚠️ This action is permanent. Cannot be rolled back.


🔹 4️⃣ TRUNCATE — Remove all data but keep structure => Deletes all rows instantly
Resets auto-increment, Much faster than DELETE, Structure remains

Example: TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
✔ Table remains
✔ Rows removed
✔ Faster because it doesn't log row-by-row deletion


🔹 5️⃣ RENAME — Change the name of a table
Example: RENAME TABLE Employees TO Staff;

🎯 Short Interview Answer
DDL commands are used to define and manage the database structure.
They include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, and RENAME.
DDL changes the schema and is auto-committed.


🔥 TRUNCATE vs DROP vs DELETE (SQL Difference)
| Feature                      | **DELETE**                   | **TRUNCATE**                                  | **DROP**                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------  | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Type**                     | DML (Data Manipulation)      | DDL (Data Definition)                         | DDL (Data Definition)           |
| **Deletes**                  | Specific rows                | All rows                                      | Entire table (structure + data) |
| **WHERE clause**             | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No                                         | ❌ No                           |
| **Rollback**                 | ✅ Yes (if in a transaction) | ⚠️ Depends (usually cannot, treated like DDL) | ❌ Cannot                       |
| **Speed**                    | Slow (row-by-row)            | Very fast                                     | Fast                            |
| **Removes table structure?** | ❌ No                        | ❌ No                                         | ✅ Yes                          |


**********************************************************************************************************************************************

🔥 DML Commands in SQL
DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve data in a database table.
They operate on the data, not on the structure.

✅ 1. INSERT => Used to insert new rows into a table.
Example 1: Insert single row
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)
VALUES (1, 'Suyog', 50000);

Example 2: Insert multiple rows
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)
VALUES 
(2, 'Amit', 45000),
(3, 'Riya', 60000);

✅ 2. UPDATE => Used to modify existing rows.
Example:
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 70000
WHERE id = 3;

Update all rows (⚠️ risky)
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 5000;

✅ 3. DELETE => Used to delete specific rows.
Example:
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id = 2;

Delete all rows (but keep structure)
DELETE FROM employees;

✅ 4. SELECT => Used to retrieve data from a table.
Example:
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;


❓ Is SELECT a DML command? 👉 Yes. SELECT retrieves data, so it is considered part of DML.
❓ Can DML operations be rolled back? 👉 Yes, DML commands can be rolled back if inside a transaction.


*******************************************************************************************************************************************

🔥 DCL Commands in SQL (Data Control Language)

DCL commands are used to control access, permissions, and security of the database.

There are two main DCL commands: 1️⃣ GRANT, 2️⃣ REVOKE

✅ 1. GRANT : Used to give permissions to a user on database objects (tables, views, etc.)
Example: Give SELECT permission
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;

Example: Give multiple permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
ON employees
TO user1;

Example: Give all permissions
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON employees TO user1;

✅ 2. REVOKE : Used to take back permissions previously granted.
Example: Remove SELECT permission
REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user1;

Example: Remove all privileges
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON employees FROM user1;


******************************************************************************************************************************************************

🔥 TCL Commands in SQL (Transaction Control Language)
TCL commands are used to manage transactions in a database.
A transaction is a set of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit — either all succeed or all fail.

TCL Includes These Commands: 1️⃣ COMMIT, 2️⃣ ROLLBACK, 3️⃣ SAVEPOINT

✅ 1. COMMIT : Permanently saves all changes made in the current transaction.

Example:

BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

👉 After COMMIT, changes cannot be undone.


✅ 2. ROLLBACK : Undoes all changes made in the current transaction.

Example:

BEGIN;
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 10;
ROLLBACK;

👉 The DELETE action is undone.


✅ 3. SAVEPOINT : Creates a checkpoint in a transaction so you can roll back partially, not the entire transaction.

Example:

BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE id = 1;
SAVEPOINT sp1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
ROLLBACK TO sp1;
COMMIT;

📌 Meaning:
First update is kept
Second update is undone


**********************************************************************************************************
🔥 DQL (Data Query Language)
DQL is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from the database.
It focuses only on querying data, not modifying it.

✅ Main DQL Command: SELECT
There is only one DQL command, and that is: ➡️ SELECT

Used to query and fetch data from one or more tables.
📌 Interview Summary
DQL = SELECT
Used to fetch/query data
Does NOT modify data
Part of SQL that deals with reading data only


********************************************************************************************************************************

🔥 SQL Operators
SQL operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data in queries.
They are mainly used inside WHERE, HAVING, and SELECT statements.

Operators are divided into several types:
1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators => % ( modulo operator ) -> reminder
2️⃣ Comparison (Relational) Operators => <> is same to !=
3️⃣ Logical Operators => AND,	OR,  NOT
4️⃣ Bitwise Operators => & (and), ^ (xor), | (or)  => SELECT 5 & 3;   -- Output: 1
5️⃣ Special / Other Operators => IN, NOT IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL / IS NOT NULL, EXISTS, ANY / ALL



1️⃣ BETWEEN => Used to check range (inclusive).

Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 60000;

✔ Includes 30000 and 60000.
✔ Works with numbers, dates, text.


2️⃣ IN => Used to match multiple values.
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('IT', 'HR', 'Finance');

✔ Same as using multiple OR conditions
✔ Cleaner and faster


3️⃣ NOT IN => Opposite of IN.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department NOT IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');


4️⃣ LIKE => Used for pattern matching with wildcards.

Wildcards:
| Symbol | Meaning                  |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| `%`    | any number of characters |
| `_`    | exactly one character    |

Examples:
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'S%';   -- starts with S
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '%n';   -- ends with n
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '%an%'; -- contains 'an'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '_a%';  -- 2nd letter is a



5️⃣ IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
✔ You cannot use = NULL or != NULL
❌ Wrong → WHERE manager_id = NULL
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL;


7️⃣ EXISTS => Returns TRUE if the subquery returns at least one row.
Example:
SELECT name FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM projects p WHERE p.emp_id = e.id
);

✔ Used for checking existence
✔ Faster than IN for large data
✔ Very important for interviews


8️⃣ NOT EXISTS => Opposite of EXISTS.
Example:
SELECT name FROM employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM projects p WHERE p.emp_id = e.id
);

Finds employees with no projects.


9️⃣ ANY => Condition must be true for at least one value.
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM interns);

Meaning: salary > smallest intern salary


🔟 ALL => Condition must be true for all values.
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM interns);

Meaning: salary > highest intern salary


********************************************************
🔥 IN vs EXISTS (Most Asked SQL Interview Question)
Both IN and EXISTS are used with subqueries, but they work differently internally.

✅ 1️⃣ IN — compares values
IN checks whether a value is present in a list returned by a subquery.
Example:
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE id IN (SELECT emp_id FROM projects);

➡ Finds employees who have projects.
➡ Subquery returns a list → main query checks membership.


✅ 2️⃣ EXISTS — checks existence of rows
EXISTS returns TRUE if the subquery returns at least one row.
Example:
SELECT name FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM projects p WHERE p.emp_id = e.id
);

➡ Also finds employees who have projects,
but it works differently internally.


🔥 Real Difference (Very Important)

✔ EXISTS is correlated => Subquery depends on outer query.
WHERE EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM projects p 
      WHERE p.emp_id = e.id
)

For each employee, SQL checks if a matching project exists.


✔ IN stores values from the subquery and compares
WHERE id IN (SELECT emp_id FROM projects)

The subquery returns a list of IDs first.


🚀 Performance Difference
✔ Use EXISTS when the outer table is large => EXISTS stops as soon as it finds a match → faster.
✔ Use IN when the subquery result is small => IN compares values → faster when few values.


⚠️ Very Important Case: NULL values

Suppose the subquery returns a NULL:

SELECT emp_id FROM projects;

If one emp_id is NULL:

➤ IN breaks!
WHERE id IN (NULL) → always FALSE

➤ EXISTS works fine (NULL doesn’t matter)

Exists checks only rows, not values.

👉 EXISTS is safer when NULLs are present.


| Feature          | IN                | EXISTS               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| What it checks   | Value list        | Row existence        |
| Best when        | Subquery is small | Outer table is large |
| Deals with NULLs | ❌ Problematic     | ✔ Safe               |
| How it works     | Compares values   | Checks row existence |
| Type             | Non-correlated    | Correlated subquery  |

✔ Final One-Line Answer for Interviews
IN compares values and may perform poorly with large lists or NULL values, while EXISTS checks for the presence of rows and performs better with large datasets.


*****************************************************************************************************************************************************

🔥 ANY vs ALL in SQL
Both ANY and ALL are used with subqueries to compare values.
They modify comparison operators (>, <, =, !=, etc.)

✅ 1️⃣ ANY (or SOME) 👉 Think: “If it matches ANY one value, return TRUE”

✔ Another Example:    WHERE age = ANY (30, 40, 50)  <==> Equivalent to <==>  WHERE age IN (30, 40, 50)
👉 ANY = IN when used with = operator.


✅ 2️⃣ ALL 👉 Think: “Must satisfy the condition for all values”

✔ Another Example:   WHERE age != ALL (30, 40, 50)  <==> Equivalent to <==>  WHERE age NOT IN (30, 40, 50)
👉 != ALL => NOT IN

| Feature         | ANY                                    | ALL                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Condition       | True if matches **one or more** values | True only if matches **every** value |
| Logical meaning | At least one                           | Every one                            |
| Works like      | MIN check (for >)                      | MAX check (for >)                    |
| Example meaning | > ANY (values) → > minimum             | > ALL (values) → > maximum           |

🎯 Final Interview Answer (Short)
ANY returns TRUE if the condition matches at least one value from the subquery.
ALL returns TRUE only if the condition matches every value in the subquery.
> ANY compares with the minimum, while > ALL compares with the maximum.

🔥 What is a VIEW in SQL?
A View is a virtual table created from the result of a SQL query.
It does not store data physically (most of the time) — it only stores the query, and data is fetched from underlying tables whenever the view is used.
👉 Think of a view as a saved SQL query that behaves like a table.

Create a view:
CREATE VIEW emp_it AS
SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';

Now you can treat the view like a table:

SELECT * FROM emp_it;

➡ Shows only IT department employees.


❓ 2. Why use views?
To simplify queries, secure sensitive data, improve abstraction and Reusability & Maintainability

✅ SQL Clauses
SQL Clauses are special keywords used in a query to filter, sort, group, or limit data.
They help define conditions, ranges, and structure of SELECT operations.
A clause is not a command by itself — it is a part of a SQL query.

⭐ List of Major SQL Clauses
| Clause             | Purpose                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **WHERE**          | Filters rows based on condition    |
| **HAVING**         | Filters groups after aggregation   |
| **ORDER BY**       | Sorts result (ASC/DESC)            |
| **GROUP BY**       | Groups rows for aggregation        |
| **LIMIT / OFFSET** | Restricts number of rows returned  |
| **DISTINCT**       | Removes duplicate rows             |
| **BETWEEN**        | Filters values in a range          |
| **LIKE**           | Filters using pattern matching     |
| **IN**             | Filters using multiple values      |
| **EXISTS**         | Checks if subquery returns any row |
| **AND / OR**       | Combine conditions                 |
| **IS NULL**        | Check NULL values                  |


************************************************************************************************
📌 5. LIMIT & OFFSET (MySQL) => Used to return limited rows.
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;

(returns 5 rows starting from the 11th row)
************************************************************************************************

⭐ Example Combining Most Clauses

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 30000              -- filter rows
GROUP BY department                -- group rows
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5               -- filter groups
ORDER BY total DESC               -- sorting
LIMIT 3;                          -- limit results



🧠 KEY DIFFERENCE TABLE ✅ WHERE vs HAVING
| Feature               | WHERE           | HAVING                   |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Filters               | Rows            | Groups (aggregated data) |
| Used When             | Before GROUP BY | After GROUP BY           |
| Works on              | Individual rows | Aggregated results       |
| Can use aggregates?   | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes                   |
| Query execution stage | Early           | After grouping           |

⭐ Memory Trick
👉 WHERE = Filter BEFORE grouping => Can not use aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM).
👉 HAVING = Filter AFTER grouping => Can use aggregate functions.


***************************************************************************************************************

✅ What Are Aggregate Functions in SQL?
Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value (summary).

⭐ List of Major Aggregate Functions
| Function    | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **COUNT()** | Counts rows                       |
| **SUM()**   | Returns total of a numeric column |
| **AVG()**   | Returns average value             |
| **MAX()**   | Returns maximum value             |
| **MIN()**   | Returns minimum value             |


⭐ Important Notes (Interview Points)

🔹 Aggregate functions ignore NULL values
Example: SELECT AVG(bonus) FROM employees;
If some bonuses are NULL → they are skipped.


🔹 Aggregate functions require GROUP BY when selecting NON-aggregated columns

❌ Invalid: (If department is not grouped)
SELECT department, SUM(salary)
FROM employees;

✔ Correct:
SELECT department, SUM(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;


🔹 Aggregate functions can be used in HAVING but not in WHERE

❌ Invalid: WHERE COUNT(*) > 5

✔ Valid: HAVING COUNT(*) > 5


****************************************************************************************************************************

✅ What Are SQL Constraints?
SQL Constraints are rules applied on table columns to ensure the correctness, reliability, and integrity of the data.
They prevent invalid data from entering the database.

⭐ Types of SQL Constraints
| Constraint                 | Purpose                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **NOT NULL**               | Ensures a column cannot store NULL values        |
| **UNIQUE**                 | Ensures all values in a column are unique        |
| **PRIMARY KEY**            | Uniquely identifies each row (NOT NULL + UNIQUE) |
| **FOREIGN KEY**            | Creates a link between two tables                |
| **CHECK**                  | Ensures a condition must be true                 |
| **DEFAULT**                | Sets a default value if none is provided         |
| **AUTO_INCREMENT** (MySQL) | Automatically generates unique values            |


⭐ Example: Table With All Constraints
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    age INT CHECK(age >= 18),
    department_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 30000,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);

Composite Primary Key: PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)


⭐ INTERVIEW KEY POINTS
✔ PRIMARY KEY = UNIQUE + NOT NULL
✔ FOREIGN KEY ensures referential integrity
✔ CHECK used for conditions
✔ DEFAULT assigns automatic values
✔ Constraints prevent invalid data before saving
✔ You cannot have two primary keys but can have multiple unique keys

⭐ Constraints Can Be Added Later (ALTER TABLE)
Add constraint:
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (salary > 10000);

Drop constraint:
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP CONSTRAINT chk_salary;



✅ What Are Aliases in SQL?
Aliases are temporary names given to columns or tables in SQL queries to make them:
Shorter
More readable
Easier to reference

Aliases do not change the original table/column name.
They exist only for that particular query.

You create an alias using the keyword AS (optional in SQL).

⭐ Types of Aliases
1) Column Alias
2) Table Alias

📌 Aliases Cannot Be Used in WHERE Clause
(Because WHERE executes before SELECT)

❌ Invalid:
SELECT salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees
WHERE annual_salary > 500000;


✔ Use HAVING (or repeat expression):

SELECT salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees
HAVING annual_salary > 500000;

or

SELECT salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary * 12 > 500000;


⭐ Interview Summary (Quick)

Aliases are temporary names for columns or tables
Created with or without AS
Useful in joins, subqueries, and calculated columns
Mandatory in self-joins
Not allowed in WHERE clause
