❓ Is React a framework?
❌ No, it’s a library.

What is React?
React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook (Meta) for building fast, interactive, and reusable user interfaces, 
especially single-page applications (SPAs). It follows a component-based architecture and uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI.


👇 Key Features of React

1️⃣ Component-Based Architecture ⭐⭐⭐
UI is divided into reusable components
Improves maintainability and scalability

function Button() {
  return <button>Click</button>;
}

2️⃣ Virtual DOM ⭐⭐⭐
Lightweight copy of the real DOM
Updates only the changed parts of the UI
Improves performance

3️⃣ Declarative UI
Describe what the UI should look like
React handles how to update it

{isLoggedIn && <Dashboard />}

4️⃣ One-Way Data Binding
Data flows from parent → child
Predictable and easy to debug

5️⃣ JSX (JavaScript XML)
Write HTML inside JavaScript
Improves readability and developer experience

6️⃣ Reusability
Components can be reused across the application
Reduces code duplication

7️⃣ Hooks (Functional Components) ⭐⭐⭐
Use state and lifecycle features in functional components

Common hooks:
useState
useEffect
useContext
useRef

8️⃣ Fast Rendering & Performance Optimization
Efficient diffing
Batching updates
Memoization (React.memo, useMemo)

9️⃣ Strong Ecosystem
React Router
Redux / Zustand
Axios
Next.js

🔟 Cross-Platform Support
Web → React
Mobile → React Native

1️⃣1️⃣ Easy Integration
Can be integrated with any backend (Node, Java, Python)

One-Minute Interview Answer ⭐
React offers a component-based architecture, virtual DOM for efficient updates, declarative UI, one-way data flow, JSX, hooks for state management, 
and strong ecosystem support.


What is JSX?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript to describe the UI.

Why JSX is Used?
✔ Makes code more readable
✔ Combines UI and logic in one place
✔ Improves developer experience

Example
const element = <h1>Hello React</h1>;

JSX is not HTML — it gets converted into JavaScript.


className in JSX not class

One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like UI code inside React components.



Components in React
Components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component is an independent, reusable piece of UI that controls its own structure, logic, and behavior.


Why Components are Important?
✔ Reusability
✔ Maintainability
✔ Scalability
✔ Separation of concerns


Component Rules (Interview Important)
Component names must start with capital letters
Must return JSX
Must be pure (same input → same output)


One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
Components are reusable, independent UI blocks in React that manage their own logic and rendering.

❓ Does React re-render the whole page?
❌ No, only changed components.


Props in React
Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component to share data and configuration.

Why Props are Used?
✔ Pass data between components
✔ Make components reusable & dynamic
✔ Maintain one-way data flow (parent → child)

Example
Parent Component
function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Suyog" age={23} />;
}

Child Component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello {props.name}, Age: {props.age}</h1>;
}

Props are Read-Only ⚠️
❌ Cannot modify props inside the child component
props.name = "Amit"; // ❌ Not allowed




State in React
State is a built-in object in React used to store and manage component-specific, dynamic data that can change over time and cause the component to re-render when updated.

Why State is Needed?
✔ Manage dynamic UI data
✔ Trigger re-render on data change
✔ Maintain component behavior

Example (useState Hook)
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}

       
Key Points About State (Interview Important ⭐)
State is mutable
State changes trigger re-render
State is local to the component
State updates are asynchronous

       
State vs Props (Very Important ⭐)
| Props                      | State                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Passed from parent         | Managed inside component    |
| Read-only                  | Mutable                     |
| Used for configuration     | Used for dynamic data       |
| Cannot be changed by child | Can be changed using setter |
| External to component      | Internal to component       |

       
When to Use What?
✔ Use props → to pass data or functions
✔ Use state → to manage changing UI data
       
Updating State Correctly
❌ Wrong
count = count + 1;

✅ Correct
setCount(count + 1);

Functional Updates (Best Practice)
setCount(prev => prev + 1);

Used when new state depends on old state.

       
Multiple State Variables
const [name, setName] = useState("");
const [age, setAge] = useState(0);

When Does State Re-render?
✔ State update
✔ Props update

One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
State is a mutable data object that controls a component’s behavior and triggers re-rendering when it changes.

Common Interview Questions
❓ Is state global?
❌ No, state is local (unless using Context/Redux).




Hooks in React
Hooks are special functions in React that allow functional components to use state, lifecycle features, and other React functionalities without writing class components.

Why Hooks Were Introduced? ⭐
✔ Avoid class components
✔ Reuse stateful logic
✔ Cleaner & readable code
✔ Better separation of concerns

Rules of Hooks (Very Important ⚠️)
1️⃣ Only call hooks at the top level
2️⃣ Only call hooks inside React components or custom hooks

Most Important React Hooks
1️⃣ useState
Manages component state.
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

2️⃣ useEffect ⭐⭐⭐
Handles side effects (API calls, subscriptions).

useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);


Common Hooks:
useState
useEffect
useContext
useRef
useMemo
useCallback


One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
Hooks allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features in React.




useEffect in React – Deep Dive
useEffect is a hook in React that lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, 
or manually updating the DOM. It replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.

Basic Syntax
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code here
});

Dependency Array
useEffect accepts a second argument, the dependency array [].

| Dependency Array | Behavior                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Not provided     | Runs **after every render** (mount + update) |
| `[]` (empty)     | Runs **only once** after component mounts    |
| `[dep1, dep2]`   | Runs **when any dependency changes**         |


Examples
1️⃣ Run on every render (no dependency)
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component rendered");
});

2️⃣ Run only on mount
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted");
}, []);

3️⃣ Run when dependencies change
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Count changed:", count);
}, [count]);



❓ What happens if you omit the dependency array?
The effect runs after every render, which can cause performance issues.


1️⃣3️⃣ Conditional Rendering
{isLoggedIn ? <Home /> : <Login />}


1️⃣8️⃣ React Router
Used for navigation in SPA.

<Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />


React Router – Complete Guide for Interviews
React Router is a library for routing in React applications that allows navigation between different components (pages) without reloading the entire page, 
enabling single-page applications (SPA) behavior.

Why React Router?
SPAs don’t reload the page
Keeps URL in sync with UI
Enables nested routing
Supports dynamic routing

Installation
npm install react-router-dom

Core Components of React Router

1️⃣ BrowserRouter
Wraps the entire app
Keeps UI in sync with URL

import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

<BrowserRouter>
  <App />
</BrowserRouter>


2️⃣ Routes
Container for all route definitions

import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>


3️⃣ Route
Defines path → component mapping
path → URL path
element → Component to render

<Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />


4️⃣ Link
Used to navigate without page reload

import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

<Link to="/about">About</Link>


Advantages of React Router
✔ Single-page navigation
✔ Dynamic routing support
✔ Nested routes for modular UI
✔ Supports route parameters & query strings

Common Interview Questions
❓ What is the difference between Link and a tag?
<Link> → SPA navigation (no reload)
<a> → full page reload

*****************************************************************

❓ Why hooks were introduced?
✔ To use state & lifecycle in functional components.



1️⃣9️⃣ useRef
Access DOM
Persist values without re-render

const inputRef = useRef();

2️⃣0️⃣ Memoization ⭐
useMemo
Prevents expensive recalculations.

useCallback
Prevents unnecessary function recreation.

2️⃣1️⃣ React.memo
Prevents unnecessary re-renders of components.


❓ What is SPA?
Single Page Application without full page reload.

❓ Can React be used with backend?
✔ Yes (Node, Java, Python, etc.)




Redux – Complete Guide for Interviews
Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React, that helps manage global state in a centralized store. 
It ensures the app’s state is consistent and easier to debug.

Why Redux? ⭐
React state is local, Redux allows global state management
Makes data flow predictable
Helps with complex apps
Easier to debug using DevTools

Core Concepts of Redux
1️⃣ Store
Centralized place to hold the application state
Only one store per app is recommended

2️⃣ Actions
Objects that describe what happened
Must have a type field

const increment = { type: "INCREMENT" };

3️⃣ Reducers
Functions that take current state + action and return new state
Pure function: no side effects

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT": return state + 1;
    case "DECREMENT": return state - 1;
    default: return state;
  }
};

4️⃣ Dispatch
Method used to send actions to the store

store.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });

5️⃣ Selector / getState
Get data from the store

const currentCount = store.getState();

6️⃣ Provider
Wrap React app to connect store

import { Provider } from "react-redux";

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>

7️⃣ connect / useSelector / useDispatch
useSelector → access state
useDispatch → send actions


*********************** Redux Flow Diagram *******************
Component → Dispatch Action → Reducer → Store Updated → UI Rerenders

Advantages of Redux
✔ Centralized state
✔ Predictable & testable
✔ Debugging easier (Redux DevTools)
✔ Middleware support (Thunk, Saga)

Common Redux Interview Questions
❓ Difference between Redux and React state?
React state → local
Redux → global, centralized


One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
Redux is a predictable state management library that centralizes the app state in a store, uses actions to describe changes, 
reducers to update state, and enables consistent and debuggable data flow.
