🔥 TOP 25 COMPUTER NETWORK INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
1. What is a computer network?
A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that share data and resources.

What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a collection of two or more devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) connected together to share data, resources, 
and services using communication protocols.

Key Points (for interviews)
Enables data communication
Shares resources (files, printers, internet)
Uses protocols like TCP/IP
Can be wired or wireless

Simple Example : Internet, Office LAN, Mobile hotspot network

One-Line Answer ⭐
A computer network allows connected devices to communicate and share resources.


2. Types of networks
LAN – Local Area Network
MAN – Metropolitan Area Network
WAN – Wide Area Network


Types of Computer Networks
Computer networks are classified based on their coverage area and usage.

1. LAN (Local Area Network)
Covers a small area (home, office, school)
High speed, low cost
Example: Office Wi-Fi

2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
Covers a city or campus
Larger than LAN, smaller than WAN
Example: City-wide broadband network

3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
Covers a large geographic area (countries/continents)
Slower than LAN, expensive
Example: Internet

4. PAN (Personal Area Network)
Very short range (few meters)
Connects personal devices
Example: Bluetooth, Hotspot

5. WLAN (Wireless LAN)
LAN using wireless technology
Example: Wi-Fi network

6. CAN (Campus Area Network)
Connects multiple LANs within a campus
Example: University network

Interview One-Line Summary ⭐
Networks are classified as PAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN based on coverage area.



3. What is the OSI model?
A 7-layer reference model that standardizes network communication.


OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
The OSI model is a 7-layer reference model that explains how data is transmitted from one computer to another over a network. 
It was developed by ISO to standardize network communication.

Why OSI Model is Important?
Standardizes networking
Helps in troubleshooting
Improves understanding of data flow
Vendor-independent

7 Layers of OSI Model (Top → Bottom)

7. Application Layer
Provides network services to users
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP
Used by browsers, email clients

6. Presentation Layer
Data formatting, encryption, compression
Converts data into readable format

5. Session Layer
Manages sessions between devices
Establishes, maintains, terminates sessions

4. Transport Layer
Ensures reliable data delivery
Protocols: TCP, UDP
Uses port numbers

3. Network Layer
Handles routing and logical addressing
Protocols: IP, ICMP
Device: Router

2. Data Link Layer
Handles physical addressing (MAC)
Error detection
Device: Switch

1. Physical Layer
Transmits raw binary data (0s & 1s)
Cables, voltage, connectors

Interview One-Line Answer ⭐
OSI model is a 7-layer framework that defines how data is transmitted over a network.



5. TCP vs UDP
TCP	UDP
Reliable	Unreliable
Connection-oriented	Connectionless
Slower	Faster
6. What is IP address?

A unique identifier assigned to devices on a network.

7. IPv4 vs IPv6

IPv4 → 32-bit

IPv6 → 128-bit

8. What is MAC address?

A hardware address uniquely assigned to a network interface.

9. What is DNS?

Domain Name System converts domain names into IP addresses.

10. What is HTTP vs HTTPS?

HTTPS is HTTP secured using SSL/TLS encryption.

11. What is a port?

A logical endpoint for communication.

12. Common port numbers

HTTP – 80

HTTPS – 443

FTP – 21

SMTP – 25

SSH – 22

13. What is subnetting?

Dividing a network into smaller networks for efficiency.

14. What is a firewall?

A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic.

15. What is NAT?

Network Address Translation maps private IPs to public IPs.

16. What is a protocol?

A set of rules governing data communication.

17. What is bandwidth?

Maximum data transfer capacity of a network.

18. What is latency?

Delay in data transmission.

19. What is packet switching?

Data is broken into packets and sent independently.

20. What is ARP?

Address Resolution Protocol maps IP address to MAC address.

21. What is ICMP?

Used for error reporting and diagnostics (e.g., ping).

22. What is a router?

Connects multiple networks and routes data.

23. What is a switch?

Connects devices within a LAN.

24. What is a hub?

Broadcasts data to all devices (obsolete).

25. What is VPN?

Creates a secure encrypted tunnel over public networks.

⭐ ONE-LINE INTERVIEW SUMMARY

Computer networks enable communication between devices using standardized protocols and layered architecture.
