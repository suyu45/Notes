Question: What is Express.js?
Express.js is a minimal, fast, and flexible web framework for Node.js used to build web applications and RESTful APIs. It simplifies server-side development 
by providing features like routing, middleware, request–response handling, and error management on top of Node.js.

Key Points to Mention:
Built on Node.js
Uses middleware to process requests
Supports routing for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Ideal for REST APIs and backend services
Lightweight and highly extensible

One-line Answer (Quick):
Express.js is a lightweight Node.js framework that simplifies building web servers and REST APIs.



What is an API?
API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and endpoints that allows two software applications to communicate with each other.

One-line interview answer ⭐
An API allows different applications to communicate by sending requests and receiving responses.

Why APIs are Used?
To enable communication between client and server
To share data and functionality
To build scalable and modular applications
To allow frontend and backend to work independently

Real-World Analogy
👉 Restaurant Example
You (Client) → place order
Waiter (API) → takes request
Kitchen (Server) → prepares food
Waiter (API) → delivers response
You never enter the kitchen — same way client never accesses server logic directly.



2️⃣ REST API (Very Important ⭐⭐⭐)
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing APIs using HTTP methods.

Common HTTP Methods:
| Method | Purpose        |
| ------ | -------------- |
| GET    | Fetch data     |
| POST   | Create data    |
| PUT    | Update data    |
| PATCH  | Partial update |
| DELETE | Remove data    |


API Request–Response Cycle => 
Client sends request
Server processes request
Server sends response (JSON/XML)
Client consumes response




API Status Codes (Very Important)
| Code | Meaning      |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 200  | OK           |
| 201  | Created      |
| 400  | Bad Request  |
| 401  | Unauthorized |
| 403  | Forbidden    |
| 404  | Not Found    |
| 500  | Server Error |

One-Minute Interview Answer ⭐
An API is a communication interface that allows applications to exchange data. In web development, APIs commonly use HTTP methods like GET and POST
to perform CRUD operations, following REST principles and returning data in JSON format.


What is a REST API?
REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web API that follows REST architectural principles and uses HTTP methods to perform operations on resources.

One-line interview answer ⭐
A REST API allows clients to interact with server resources using standard HTTP methods in a stateless way.


REST API Example (Express.js)
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Users fetched" });
});

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.status(201).json({ message: "User created" });
});


❓ Which data format is used?
👉 Mostly JSON, sometimes XML.

❓ Why REST API is popular?
👉 Simple, scalable, lightweight, works well with HTTP.

One-Minute Interview Answer ⭐
A REST API is an architectural style for building web services that uses HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources. 
It is stateless, scalable, and commonly returns JSON responses.


Question: Why Express.js?
Express.js is used because it simplifies building web servers and REST APIs in Node.js by providing features like routing, middleware, 
and easier request–response handling, while remaining fast and lightweight.


1️⃣ Simplifies Server Creation
With plain Node.js, handling routes and requests is complex.
Express provides a clean and simple API.

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

2️⃣ Powerful Routing System
Supports routing based on:
URL
HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Helps in building RESTful APIs easily.

3️⃣ Middleware Support (Biggest Advantage ⭐⭐⭐)

Middleware allows you to:
Authenticate users
Validate requests
Handle errors

Parse request bodies
app.use(express.json());

4️⃣ Lightweight & Fast
Minimal framework with no unnecessary features
High performance due to Node.js event-driven architecture

5️⃣ Easy Integration
Works smoothly with:
Databases (MongoDB, MySQL)
Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
Template engines (EJS, Pug)
Frontend frameworks (React, Angular)

6️⃣ Supports MVC Architecture
Helps organize code into:
Models
Views
Controllers

Makes applications scalable and maintainable

7️⃣ Large Community & Ecosystem
Thousands of plugins and middleware
Excellent documentation
Strong community support


| Node.js          | Express.js             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Low-level APIs   | High-level abstraction |
| Manual routing   | Built-in routing       |
| More boilerplate | Less code              |
| Harder to manage | Easy & structured      |


2️⃣ Why Express.js?
Simplifies HTTP server creation
Easy routing
Powerful middleware system
Faster development than plain Node.js
Large community support



What is Routing in Express.js?
Routing in Express.js is the mechanism that handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to specific functions (controllers) based on the URL path and HTTP method.

Basic Routing Syntax
app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

METHOD → HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
PATH → URL
HANDLER → callback function

Example
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Login Success');
});


5️⃣ Router-Level Routing (express.Router) ⭐⭐⭐
Used for modular and scalable apps.

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('All users');
});

router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Add user');
});

module.exports = router;

//**********
app.use('/users', router);


❓ What is express.Router()?
👉 A mini Express app used to group routes


What is Middleware in Express.js?
Middleware is a function that has access to the request (req), response (res), and next() function, and it executes between the request and the response.

Middleware Function Syntax
(req, res, next) => {
  // logic
  next();
}

req → request object
res → response object
next() → passes control to next middleware

Why Middleware is Used? (Interview ⭐)
Authentication & Authorization
Logging
Validation
Error handling
Request parsing
Code reusability


Middleware Execution Flow
Request → Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Route Handler → Response


Route-Specific Middleware
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers.authorization) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
  next();
};

app.get('/dashboard', auth, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome');
});


Multiple Middleware
app.get('/test', m1, m2, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Done');
});


What Happens If next() Is Not Called? ⚠️
Request gets stuck
Response is never sent


Common Interview Questions & Answers
❓ What is next()?
👉 Passes control to next middleware

❓ Order of middleware matters?
👉 Yes, executed top-to-bottom

❓ Can middleware modify req/res?
👉 Yes

❓ Can we send response in middleware?
👉 Yes (authentication failure, errors)

One-Minute Interview Answer ⭐
Middleware in Express.js is a function that runs between the request and response. It can access req, res, and next(), 
and is used for tasks like authentication, logging, validation, and error handling.



What is Error Handling in Express.js?
Error handling in Express.js is the process of catching, managing, and responding to errors that occur during request processing, 
so the server doesn’t crash and returns meaningful responses.

Why Error Handling is Important?
Prevents server crashes
Improves debugging
Returns proper HTTP status codes
Enhances user experience
Makes APIs production-ready


8️⃣ How do you handle errors in Express?
Using error-handling middleware (err, req, res, next).

One-Minute Interview Answer ⭐
Error handling in Express.js is done using try-catch, next(err), and a special error-handling middleware with four parameters. 
It helps return proper responses and prevents server crashes.



What is CORS?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by browsers that restricts web applications running on one origin (domain)
from accessing resources on another origin unless explicitly allowed by the server.

One-line interview answer ⭐
CORS is a mechanism to allow or restrict cross-origin HTTP requests in web applications.


Same-Origin Policy Example
Your frontend: http://localhost:3000
Your backend: http://localhost:5000

By default, frontend cannot make AJAX requests to backend because origins are different.


4️⃣ CORS Options
methods → allowed HTTP methods
allowedHeaders → allowed headers
credentials → send cookies

app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT'],
  credentials: true
}));
