1. What is SQL?
=> • SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is used for storing and managing data in Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
   • It is a standard language for Relational Database System. It enables a user to create, read, update and delete relational databases and tables.
   • All the RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.
   • SQL allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements.
   • Using the SQL statements, you can perform most of the actions in a database.


SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to store, manage, and retrieve data from relational databases.
It is used to:
- Create databases and tables
- Insert, update, delete records
- Query data => fetch data
- Control permissions
- Maintain data integrity

SQL works on relational databases, where data is stored in tables (rows + columns).

📌 Why is SQL needed?
Imagine you have millions of customer records.
You cannot search manually — you need a language to interact with the database.
SQL acts as a communication language between the user/program and the database.
📌 Example : Query: Fetch customers from Pune

📌 Key Features of SQL
1️⃣ Easy to Learn and Use : SQL uses simple English-like syntax.

2️⃣ Faster Query Processing
SQL is optimized for:
Searching, Filtering, Inserting, Updating, Deleting, Aggregating large records
Example: Retrieving 10,000 student records with conditions is almost instant.

4️⃣ Supports Large Databases
SQL can handle huge volumes of data (millions of rows) efficiently.
Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and banks rely on SQL databases because of scalability.

5️⃣ Supports Multiple Operations
SQL supports all the essential operations for data management:
1) DDL (Create/Alter structure)
2) DML (Insert/Update/Delete data)
3) DQL (Fetch data)
4) DCL (Security/Permissions)
5) TCL (Transactions)
This makes SQL a complete data management language.

6️⃣ High Security
SQL helps control database access using permissions.
Example: ****** GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO user1; ****** Query *********
Only the allowed user can access specific tables.

7️⃣ Supports ACID Properties (Reliability)
SQL databases guarantee:
- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability
This ensures reliable and correct transactions, which is critical in banking, finance, healthcare, etc.

8️⃣ Integration With Programming Languages
SQL works easily with: Java (JDBC), Python (MySQL connector, SQLAlchemy), PHP, C#, Node.js
This makes it ideal for full-stack development.

9️⃣ Portable Language
SQL works on: PCs, Laptops, Servers, Cloud platforms (AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GCP SQL)
You can move databases from one environment to another easily.

🔟 Multi-User Support
Many users can access and modify the database at the same time using concurrency control systems.
Example: 1000 users booking tickets → SQL handles all transactions safely.

1️⃣1️⃣ Powerful Data Analysis & Reporting
SQL supports functions like: SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOINS, SUBQUERIES
These help in analytics, reporting, and decision-making.

🎯 Interview Summary (Short Answer)
SQL is easy to learn, highly secure, fast, reliable, standardized, scalable, supports transactions, integrates well with applications, and can handle large volumes of data efficiently.





📌 SQL vs MySQL (Tabular Difference)

🔧 Example to Understand the Difference
SQL Example (Language): SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE city = 'Pune';
This is SQL — the instruction.

MySQL Example (Database executing it)
You run the above query inside MySQL Workbench, and MySQL returns the result:
| id | name  | city |
| -- | ----- | ---- |
| 3  | Suyog | Pune |

MySQL is executing the SQL query.

📌 Key Differences in Simple Words
SQL = Grammar (language)
MySQL = Book written using that grammar (database software)

OR

SQL = What to do
MySQL = Where it is done

🎯 Interview Short Answer
SQL is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases.
MySQL is a relational database management system that uses SQL to store, retrieve, and manage data.

⭐ Examples
SQL Example (Relational) : SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE amount > 1000;
Data is stored in structured tables.

NoSQL Example (MongoDB Document)
{
  "name": "Suyog",
  "city": "Pune",
  "skills": ["C++", "SQL", "Node.js"]
}
This is stored in a flexible JSON-like document.


⭐ When to Use SQL?
Use SQL when:
✔ Data is structured
✔ Relationships are important
✔ Strong consistency is needed
✔ Operations require complex queries & joins
✔ You need ACID transactions
Examples: Banking systems, E-commerce orders/payments, Inventory systems, Enterprise backend apps

⭐ When to Use NoSQL?
Use NoSQL when:
✔ Data is unstructured or semi-structured
✔ High-speed read/write is required
✔ You need to scale horizontally
✔ Schema changes frequently
✔ Big data or real-time data processing
Examples: Social media platforms, Chat applications, Recommendation systems, IoT sensor data, Logging systems

⭐ Short Interview Summary
SQL is relational, structured, schema-based, and good for consistency.
NoSQL is non-relational, schema-less, scalable, and good for big data and real-time apps.



⭐ What are SQL Data Types?
SQL Data Types define what kind of value can be stored in a column of a table—such as:
1️⃣ Numeric Data Types
2️⃣ String / Character Data Types
3️⃣ Date & Time Data Types
4️⃣ Boolean Data Type
5️⃣ Binary Data Types
6️⃣ Special Types (ENUM, SET, JSON)

eg. salary DECIMAL(10, 2)  -- Max 10 digits, 2 after decimal

CHAR(n) =>	Fixed-length text (Faster) eg. gender CHAR(1)
VARCHAR(n)	=> Variable-length text (Most used)  eg. name VARCHAR(50)

✔ Use CHAR for fixed values like gender ('M', 'F')
✔ Use VARCHAR for names, emails, addresses


🏷️ 6. Special Data Types (MySQL)
ENUM: Stores a fixed list of values.
      eg. status ENUM('active','inactive','blocked')

🎯 Interview Short Answer
SQL data types define the kind of data a column holds, such as numeric, string, date/time, boolean, and binary types, ensuring proper storage and efficient processing.




⭐ CHAR vs VARCHAR (Very Important DBMS/SQL Interview Topic)
Both CHAR and VARCHAR are string data types, but they store data differently.

🔹 1️⃣ CHAR (Fixed-length String) => CHAR stores fixed-length data.

If you define: CHAR(10)
This column will always take 10 characters of storage.
If the input is shorter, SQL will pad it with spaces.

Example:
Value = 'ABC'
Stored as = 'ABC ' (7 trailing spaces)

✔ Fast for fixed-size data
✔ Efficient for small, predictable values
✔ No change in length → faster comparisons


🔹 2️⃣ VARCHAR (Variable-length String) => VARCHAR stores variable-length data.

If you define: VARCHAR(10)
It stores only the actual number of characters, plus 1 or 2 bytes to store length metadata.

Example:
Value = 'ABC'
Storage = 3 chars + 1 byte = 4 bytes

✔ Saves space
✔ Best when length varies
✔ Commonly used for names, emails, addresses

⭐ CHAR vs VARCHAR (Tabular Difference)
| Feature          | CHAR                             | VARCHAR                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Storage**      | Fixed-length                     | Variable-length            |
| **Speed**        | Faster                           | Slightly slower            |
| **Performance**  | Best for fixed-size data         | Best when data varies      |
| **Padding**      | Pads with spaces                 | No padding                 |
| **Use Case**     | Codes, gender, OTP, country_code | Names, emails, addresses   |
| **Memory Usage** | Always uses full size            | Uses only required memory  |

🎯 Short Interview Answer
CHAR is used for fixed-length strings and is faster but wastes space.
VARCHAR is used for variable-length strings and saves space but is slightly slower.


******************************************************************************************************************************

⭐ What is DDL?
DDL (Data Definition Language) is a set of SQL commands used to define, modify, or delete the structure of database objects such as: Tables, Views, Indexes, Schemas, Constraints
DDL changes the schema of the database.
✔ Structure-level changes
✔ Auto-committed (cannot be rolled back in many systems)

⭐ Main DDL Commands
CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME

🔹 1️⃣ CREATE — Create new database objects => Used to create a table, database, view, or index.
Example: Create a database => CREATE DATABASE companyDB;

🔹 2️⃣ ALTER — Modify the structure of an existing table
Used to:
✔ Add a column
✔ Delete a column
✔ Modify a column (change datatype, size, constraints)
✔ Add/remove constraints => same syntax as Modify a column
✔ Change Column Name (Rename Column) only in MySQL
✔ Rename a table

Example: Add a column
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);

Example: Modify a column
ALTER TABLE Employees
MODIFY salary DECIMAL(12,2);

Example: Drop a column
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP COLUMN email;

Example: Change Column Name (Rename Column)  only in MySql
ALTER TABLE Employees
CHANGE name full_name VARCHAR(60);

Add a Constraint => Example: Add NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE Employees
MODIFY name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;

Rename a Table
ALTER TABLE old_table
RENAME TO new_table;

🔹 3️⃣ DROP — Delete database objects permanently => This removes the table and all its data.
DROP TABLE Employees;
DROP DATABASE companyDB;
⚠️ This action is permanent. Cannot be rolled back.


🔹 4️⃣ TRUNCATE — Remove all data but keep structure => Deletes all rows instantly
Resets auto-increment, Much faster than DELETE, Structure remains

Example: TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
✔ Table remains
✔ Rows removed
✔ Faster because it doesn't log row-by-row deletion


🔹 5️⃣ RENAME — Change the name of a table
Example: RENAME TABLE Employees TO Staff;

🎯 Short Interview Answer
DDL commands are used to define and manage the database structure.
They include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, and RENAME.
DDL changes the schema and is auto-committed.


🔥 TRUNCATE vs DROP vs DELETE (SQL Difference)

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------  | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Type**                     | DML (Data Manipulation)      | DDL (Data Definition)                         | DDL (Data Definition)           |
| **Deletes**                  | Specific rows                | All rows                                      | Entire table (structure + data) |
| **WHERE clause**             | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No                                         | ❌ No                           |
| **Rollback**                 | ✅ Yes (if in a transaction) | ⚠️ Depends (usually cannot, treated like DDL) | ❌ Cannot                       |
| **Speed**                    | Slow (row-by-row)            | Very fast                                     | Fast                            |
| **Removes table structure?** | ❌ No                        | ❌ No                                         | ✅ Yes                          |


**********************************************************************************************************************************************

🔥 DML Commands in SQL
DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve data in a database table.
They operate on the data, not on the structure.

✅ 1. INSERT => Used to insert new rows into a table.
Example 1: Insert single row
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)
VALUES (1, 'Suyog', 50000);

Example 2: Insert multiple rows
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)
VALUES 
(2, 'Amit', 45000),
(3, 'Riya', 60000);

✅ 2. UPDATE => Used to modify existing rows.
Example:
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 70000
WHERE id = 3;

Update all rows (⚠️ risky)
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 5000;

✅ 3. DELETE => Used to delete specific rows.
Example:
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id = 2;

Delete all rows (but keep structure)
DELETE FROM employees;

✅ 4. SELECT => Used to retrieve data from a table.
Example:
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;


❓ Is SELECT a DML command? 👉 Yes. SELECT retrieves data, so it is considered part of DML.
❓ Can DML operations be rolled back? 👉 Yes, DML commands can be rolled back if inside a transaction.


*******************************************************************************************************************************************

🔥 DCL Commands in SQL (Data Control Language)

DCL commands are used to control access, permissions, and security of the database.

There are two main DCL commands: 1️⃣ GRANT, 2️⃣ REVOKE

✅ 1. GRANT : Used to give permissions to a user on database objects (tables, views, etc.)
Example: Give SELECT permission
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;

Example: Give multiple permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
ON employees
TO user1;

Example: Give all permissions
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON employees TO user1;

✅ 2. REVOKE : Used to take back permissions previously granted.
Example: Remove SELECT permission
REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user1;

Example: Remove all privileges
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON employees FROM user1;


******************************************************************************************************************************************************

🔥 TCL Commands in SQL (Transaction Control Language)
TCL commands are used to manage transactions in a database.
A transaction is a set of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit — either all succeed or all fail.

TCL Includes These Commands: 1️⃣ COMMIT, 2️⃣ ROLLBACK, 3️⃣ SAVEPOINT

✅ 1. COMMIT : Permanently saves all changes made in the current transaction.

Example:

BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

👉 After COMMIT, changes cannot be undone.


✅ 2. ROLLBACK : Undoes all changes made in the current transaction.

Example:

BEGIN;
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 10;
ROLLBACK;

👉 The DELETE action is undone.


✅ 3. SAVEPOINT : Creates a checkpoint in a transaction so you can roll back partially, not the entire transaction.

Example:

BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE id = 1;
SAVEPOINT sp1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
ROLLBACK TO sp1;
COMMIT;

📌 Meaning:
First update is kept
Second update is undone
