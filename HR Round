Question: Talk about a tough decision affecting your team or improving a process.
Descriptive Answer:
During my final year project, our team realized that a key feature we initially planned would significantly delay the project completion. After analyzing the pros and cons, 
I suggested removing the feature to ensure we met the deadline.
This was a tough decision because the feature was important, and some team members were attached to it. I discussed the reasoning with the team, highlighting the impact on 
the timeline and overall project quality. By focusing on the bigger picture, the team agreed, and we successfully delivered the project on time.
This experience taught me the importance of making informed decisions, communicating transparently, and prioritizing project goals over personal preferences. It also strengthened 
my leadership and problem-solving skills.





Question: How do you balance technical debt with new feature delivery?
Descriptive Answer:
Balancing technical debt and new feature delivery requires a mix of planning, prioritization, and communication. I start by assessing the impact of technical debt on 
the system’s performance, maintainability, and future scalability. If the debt is critical, I allocate time to refactor or optimize parts of the codebase alongside new 
feature development.
I also prioritize tasks based on urgency and business value—delivering features that bring immediate value while scheduling technical debt resolution in parallel or 
during sprint planning. Maintaining open communication with the team and stakeholders ensures everyone understands the trade-offs, timelines, and long-term benefits of 
addressing technical debt.
This approach ensures that the product continues to evolve with new features without compromising quality or long-term maintainability.

the areas where I can improve. This reflection helps me convert failure into a learning opportunity rather than a setback.
I also remind myself of my past achievements and the progress I’ve made so far, which reinforces my confidence. Setting small, achievable goals and taking consistent 
steps forward helps me regain motivation. I believe that failures are a natural part of growth, and using them to improve skills and strategy keeps me persistent and
