This taught me the importance of clear API contracts and improved my full-stack debugging skills.

A week before our final project submission, we encountered a major bug in the backend. I took the
initiative to debug the issue, collaborated with teammates to test different solutions, and worked
extra hours until it was fixed. This ensured that we met our deadline successfully.

One significant challenge I faced was during my final-year project, just a week before our submission. We encountered a critical bug in the backend that was affecting the 
entire data flow of our web application. Without fixing it, our core functionality would fail during the final evaluation.
Recognizing the urgency, I took the initiative to lead the debugging effort. I first analyzed the error logs and traced the issue to a faulty API integration. Then, 
I collaborated closely with my teammates — one focused on database checks while another worked on front-end dependencies. We tested multiple solutions, documented each attempt, 
and reviewed results systematically.
To ensure we made progress quickly, I worked extra hours, sometimes late into the night, and maintained constant communication with the team to avoid duplication of efforts. 
Eventually, we identified the root cause, implemented the fix, and ran several rounds of testing to confirm stability.
This experience taught me the importance of staying calm under pressure, dividing tasks strategically, and leveraging team collaboration to solve problems efficiently. 
In the end, we delivered the project on time, and it was well-received by the faculty.




11. How do you prioritize your work?
I use a mix of deadlines and importance. I focus on urgent and high-priority tasks first, then move to less critical ones.

When prioritizing my work, I start by understanding the scope of all tasks and categorizing them based on two key factors — urgency and importance. I typically use the 
Eisenhower Matrix approach: tasks that are both urgent and important get my immediate attention, while those that are important but not urgent are scheduled for later with clear deadlines.
I also break large tasks into smaller milestones, which helps in tracking progress and maintaining momentum.
For example, during my internship, I had to simultaneously complete a feature implementation and prepare a project report. The feature had a fixed client deadline, while the report was 
due internally a few days later. I focused first on completing and testing the feature to meet the external commitment, then dedicated time to finalizing the report.
This method ensures I deliver critical work on time without neglecting long-term goals. I also remain flexible, revisiting my priorities daily in case new urgent tasks arise.

During challenging times, I focus on creating an environment where the team feels supported, valued, and connected to the bigger picture. I start by acknowledging their hard work
and appreciating their contributions, even for small wins, because recognition can significantly boost morale.
I then work with the team to set clear, short-term goals that feel achievable, so they can see steady progress and maintain a sense of accomplishment. This helps break down 
overwhelming tasks into manageable steps. Throughout the process, I maintain open and positive communication, making sure everyone is aware of our objectives, timelines, and 
the impact of their efforts.
Additionally, I encourage collaboration, idea-sharing, and problem-solving as a group, so the team feels united in tackling challenges together. By combining recognition, achievable 
milestones, and a supportive atmosphere, I ensure that the team remains engaged, focused, and motivated, even when the situation is demanding.




39. How do you adapt to changes in the workplace?
I stay flexible, quickly learn new processes, and maintain a positive attitude toward change.

I believe adaptability is a key skill in today’s dynamic work environment. Whenever changes occur—whether it’s a shift in project requirements, the adoption of new tools, or 
organizational restructuring—I approach them with an open mind and a willingness to learn. My first step is to fully understand the nature and reason behind the change, as this
helps me align my work with the new direction.
I quickly familiarize myself with any updated processes or tools by taking notes, doing hands-on practice, and, if necessary, seeking guidance from colleagues or online resources. 
I also adjust my priorities and workflows to fit the new expectations without losing sight of deadlines or quality.
Most importantly, I maintain a positive attitude during transitions, as I’ve found that an optimistic outlook not only helps me adapt faster but also inspires confidence in 
those around me. This mindset allows me to embrace change as an opportunity for growth rather than seeing it as a disruption.




9. Tell me about your hobbies.
My hobbies include solving puzzles, which improve my logical thinking; watching movies, which helps me relax and explore creativity; and playing cricket, 
which teaches me teamwork and strategy.

My hobbies reflect a balance between mental stimulation, creativity, and physical activity. I enjoy solving puzzles such as Sudoku, crosswords, and logical riddles because they 
challenge my analytical thinking and help me improve problem-solving skills. I also like watching movies, not just for entertainment, but as a way to explore different storytelling 
techniques, cultures, and creative perspectives, which often inspire fresh ideas.
In addition, I am passionate about playing cricket. It’s a sport that has taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and strategic thinking. Being part of a cricket team has 
helped me understand the importance of coordination, trust, and playing to each member’s strengths.
Overall, my hobbies not only help me relax and recharge but also contribute to developing important skills that are useful in both personal and professional life.

Question: Talk about a tough decision affecting your team or improving a process.
Descriptive Answer:
During my final year project, our team realized that a key feature we initially planned would significantly delay the project completion. After analyzing the pros and cons, 
I suggested removing the feature to ensure we met the deadline.
This was a tough decision because the feature was important, and some team members were attached to it. I discussed the reasoning with the team, highlighting the impact on 
the timeline and overall project quality. By focusing on the bigger picture, the team agreed, and we successfully delivered the project on time.
This experience taught me the importance of making informed decisions, communicating transparently, and prioritizing project goals over personal preferences. It also strengthened 
my leadership and problem-solving skills.





Question: How do you balance technical debt with new feature delivery?
Descriptive Answer:
Balancing technical debt and new feature delivery requires a mix of planning, prioritization, and communication. I start by assessing the impact of technical debt on 
the system’s performance, maintainability, and future scalability. If the debt is critical, I allocate time to refactor or optimize parts of the codebase alongside new 
feature development.
I also prioritize tasks based on urgency and business value—delivering features that bring immediate value while scheduling technical debt resolution in parallel or 
during sprint planning. Maintaining open communication with the team and stakeholders ensures everyone understands the trade-offs, timelines, and long-term benefits of 
addressing technical debt.
This approach ensures that the product continues to evolve with new features without compromising quality or long-term maintainability.

the areas where I can improve. This reflection helps me convert failure into a learning opportunity rather than a setback.
I also remind myself of my past achievements and the progress I’ve made so far, which reinforces my confidence. Setting small, achievable goals and taking consistent 
steps forward helps me regain motivation. I believe that failures are a natural part of growth, and using them to improve skills and strategy keeps me persistent and
