❓ Is React a framework?
❌ No, it’s a library.

What is React?
React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook (Meta) for building fast, interactive, and reusable user interfaces, 
especially single-page applications (SPAs). It follows a component-based architecture and uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI.


👇 Key Features of React

1️⃣ Component-Based Architecture ⭐⭐⭐
UI is divided into reusable components
Improves maintainability and scalability

function Button() {
  return <button>Click</button>;
}

2️⃣ Virtual DOM ⭐⭐⭐
Lightweight copy of the real DOM
Updates only the changed parts of the UI
Improves performance

3️⃣ Declarative UI
Describe what the UI should look like
React handles how to update it

{isLoggedIn && <Dashboard />}

4️⃣ One-Way Data Binding
Data flows from parent → child
Predictable and easy to debug

5️⃣ JSX (JavaScript XML)
Write HTML inside JavaScript
Improves readability and developer experience

6️⃣ Reusability
Components can be reused across the application
Reduces code duplication

7️⃣ Hooks (Functional Components) ⭐⭐⭐
Use state and lifecycle features in functional components

Common hooks:
useState
useEffect
useContext
useRef

8️⃣ Fast Rendering & Performance Optimization
Efficient diffing
Batching updates
Memoization (React.memo, useMemo)

9️⃣ Strong Ecosystem
React Router
Redux / Zustand
Axios
Next.js

🔟 Cross-Platform Support
Web → React
Mobile → React Native

1️⃣1️⃣ Easy Integration
Can be integrated with any backend (Node, Java, Python)

One-Minute Interview Answer ⭐
React offers a component-based architecture, virtual DOM for efficient updates, declarative UI, one-way data flow, JSX, hooks for state management, 
and strong ecosystem support.


What is JSX?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript to describe the UI.

Why JSX is Used?
✔ Makes code more readable
✔ Combines UI and logic in one place
✔ Improves developer experience

Example
const element = <h1>Hello React</h1>;

JSX is not HTML — it gets converted into JavaScript.


className in JSX not class

One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like UI code inside React components.



Components in React
Components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component is an independent, reusable piece of UI that controls its own structure, logic, and behavior.


Why Components are Important?
✔ Reusability
✔ Maintainability
✔ Scalability
✔ Separation of concerns


Component Rules (Interview Important)
Component names must start with capital letters
Must return JSX
Must be pure (same input → same output)


One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
Components are reusable, independent UI blocks in React that manage their own logic and rendering.

❓ Does React re-render the whole page?
❌ No, only changed components.


Props in React
Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component to share data and configuration.

Why Props are Used?
✔ Pass data between components
✔ Make components reusable & dynamic
✔ Maintain one-way data flow (parent → child)

Example
Parent Component
function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Suyog" age={23} />;
}

Child Component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello {props.name}, Age: {props.age}</h1>;
}

Props are Read-Only ⚠️
❌ Cannot modify props inside the child component
props.name = "Amit"; // ❌ Not allowed




State in React
State is a built-in object in React used to store and manage component-specific, dynamic data that can change over time and cause the component to re-render when updated.

Why State is Needed?
✔ Manage dynamic UI data
✔ Trigger re-render on data change
✔ Maintain component behavior

Example (useState Hook)
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}

       
Key Points About State (Interview Important ⭐)
State is mutable
State changes trigger re-render
State is local to the component
State updates are asynchronous

       
State vs Props (Very Important ⭐)
| Props                      | State                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Passed from parent         | Managed inside component    |
| Read-only                  | Mutable                     |
| Used for configuration     | Used for dynamic data       |
| Cannot be changed by child | Can be changed using setter |
| External to component      | Internal to component       |

       
When to Use What?
✔ Use props → to pass data or functions
✔ Use state → to manage changing UI data
       
Updating State Correctly
❌ Wrong
count = count + 1;

✅ Correct
setCount(count + 1);

Functional Updates (Best Practice)
setCount(prev => prev + 1);

Used when new state depends on old state.

       
Multiple State Variables
const [name, setName] = useState("");
const [age, setAge] = useState(0);

When Does State Re-render?
✔ State update
✔ Props update

One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
State is a mutable data object that controls a component’s behavior and triggers re-rendering when it changes.

Common Interview Questions
❓ Is state global?
❌ No, state is local (unless using Context/Redux).




Hooks in React
Hooks are special functions in React that allow functional components to use state, lifecycle features, and other React functionalities without writing class components.

Why Hooks Were Introduced? ⭐
✔ Avoid class components
✔ Reuse stateful logic
✔ Cleaner & readable code
✔ Better separation of concerns

Rules of Hooks (Very Important ⚠️)
1️⃣ Only call hooks at the top level
2️⃣ Only call hooks inside React components or custom hooks

Most Important React Hooks
1️⃣ useState
Manages component state.
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

2️⃣ useEffect ⭐⭐⭐
Handles side effects (API calls, subscriptions).

useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);


Common Hooks:
useState
useEffect
useContext
useRef
useMemo
useCallback


One-Line Interview Answer ⭐
Hooks allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features in React.
