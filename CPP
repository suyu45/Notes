⭐ What is a Static Variable?
A static variable is a variable whose lifetime lasts for the entire program.
It is created only once and retains its value between function calls.

Static variables can be used:
Inside functions
Inside classes (as static data member)
As global static variables (file-level scope)

🧠 Key Properties of Static Variables
✔ 1. Memory is allocated only once
Static variables are stored in the static/global memory area, not on the stack.

✔ 2. Retains value between function calls
A normal (auto) variable is re-created every time a function is called.
A static variable keeps its updated value.

✔ 3. Default value = 0
If uninitialized, static variables automatically get 0.

✔ 4. Scope may be local, but lifetime is global
Static variable inside a function is local in scope but global in lifetime.

📌 Example 1: Static Variable in a Function

void counter() {
    static int count = 0;   // created once, retains value
    count++;
    cout << "Count = " << count << endl;
}

int main() {
    counter();
    counter();
    counter();
    return 0;
}

Output
Count = 1
Count = 2
Count = 3

👉 Normal variable would reset to 0 each time, but static variable remembers the value.

🎯 Short Interview Answer
A static variable is a variable that is created once and retains its value for the entire program lifetime.
It is stored in static memory and keeps its value between function calls.
In classes, static variables are shared by all objects.

***************************************************************************************************************************************************


⭐ Static Data Member (Static Variable in Class)
A static data member is a variable that:
Belongs to the class, not to any object.
Has only one copy shared by all objects.
Is stored in static memory (not inside each object).
Must be defined outside the class.
Can be accessed using class name as well as object.

👉 Why use static data member?
To store information common to all objects (e.g., count of objects).

******************************************
✔ Example: Static Data Member

class Student {
public:
    static int count;   // declaration
    string name;

    Student(string n) {
        name = n;
        count++;        // increment object count
    }
};

// definition outside class
int Student::count = 0;

int main() {
    Student s1("Amit");
    Student s2("Suman");

    cout << "Total students: " << Student::count;  // accessing with class name
    return 0;
}

Output:
Total students: 2
******************************************


⭐ Static Member Function
A static member function:
Can access only static data members.
Does not have this pointer (because it doesn’t belong to any object).

Can be called using:
Class name (recommended)
Object name (allowed but not preferred)

****************************************
✔ Example: Static Member Function

class Student {
public:
    static int count;   // static data member

    // Constructor increments count whenever object is created
    Student() {
        count++;
    }

    static void getCount() {
        cout << "Total objects created: " << count << endl;
    }
};

// definition of static member
int Student::count = 0;

int main() {

    Student::getCount();   // Before any object creation → 0

    Student s1;
    Student s2;
    Student s3;

    Student::getCount();   // After creating 3 objects → 3

    return 0;
}

📤 Output
Total objects created: 0
Total objects created: 3
****************************************

🎯 Short Interview Answer
Static data members belong to the class, not objects, so all objects share a single copy.
Static member functions also belong to the class and can only access static members.
