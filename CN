🔥 TOP 25 COMPUTER NETWORK INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
1. What is a computer network?
A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that share data and resources.

What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a collection of two or more devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) connected together to share data, resources, 
and services using communication protocols.

Key Points (for interviews)
Enables data communication
Shares resources (files, printers, internet)
Uses protocols like TCP/IP
Can be wired or wireless

Simple Example : Internet, Office LAN, Mobile hotspot network

One-Line Answer ⭐
A computer network allows connected devices to communicate and share resources.


2. Types of networks
LAN – Local Area Network
MAN – Metropolitan Area Network
WAN – Wide Area Network


Types of Computer Networks
Computer networks are classified based on their coverage area and usage.

1. LAN (Local Area Network)

3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
Covers a large geographic area (countries/continents)
Slower than LAN, expensive
Example: Internet

4. PAN (Personal Area Network)
Very short range (few meters)
Connects personal devices
Example: Bluetooth, Hotspot

5. WLAN (Wireless LAN)
LAN using wireless technology
Example: Wi-Fi network

6. CAN (Campus Area Network)

Example: University network

Interview One-Line Summary ⭐
Networks are classified as PAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN based on coverage area.



3. What is the OSI model?
A 7-layer reference model that standardizes network communication.


OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
The OSI model is a 7-layer reference model that explains how data is transmitted from one computer to another over a network. 
It was developed by ISO to standardize network communication.

Why OSI Model is Important?
Standardizes networking
Helps in troubleshooting
Improves understanding of data flow
Vendor-independent

7 Layers of OSI Model (Top → Bottom)

7. Application Layer
Provides network services to users
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP
Used by browsers, email clients

6. Presentation Layer
Data formatting, encryption, compression
Converts data into readable format

5. Session Layer
Manages sessions between devices
Establishes, maintains, terminates sessions

4. Transport Layer
Ensures reliable data delivery
Protocols: TCP, UDP
Uses port numbers

3. Network Layer
Handles routing and logical addressing
Protocols: IP, ICMP
Device: Router

2. Data Link Layer
Handles physical addressing (MAC)
Error detection
Device: Switch

1. Physical Layer
Transmits raw binary data (0s & 1s)
Cables, voltage, connectors

Interview One-Line Answer ⭐
OSI model is a 7-layer framework that defines how data is transmitted over a network.




TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable transport-layer protocol that ensures ordered, error-free delivery of data between two devices.

Key Features of TCP
Connection-oriented (3-way handshake)
Reliable (acknowledgements & retransmission)
Ordered delivery
Flow control (sliding window)
Congestion control
Error checking

TCP 3-Way Handshake
SYN → Client requests connection
SYN-ACK → Server acknowledges
ACK → Connection established

Where TCP is Used
HTTP / HTTPS
FTP
SMTP
SSH

Advantages
Guaranteed data delivery
No data loss or duplication

Disadvantages
Slower than UDP
More overhead




UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is a connectionless, unreliable transport-layer protocol that sends data without guaranteeing delivery, order, or duplication.

Key Features of UDP
Connectionless (no handshake)
Unreliable (no acknowledgements)
No error recovery
Faster than TCP
Low overhead

Where UDP is Used
Video streaming
Online gaming
VoIP (calls)
DNS
Live broadcasts

Advantages
Very fast
Ideal for real-time communication

Disadvantages
Packet loss possible
No delivery guarantee

UDP vs TCP (Quick Comparison)



TCP vs UDP (In-Depth Comparison – Interview Ready)
Both TCP and UDP are Transport Layer (Layer 4) protocols, but they are designed for different use cases.

| Feature            | **TCP**                       | **UDP**                      |
