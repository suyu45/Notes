Virtualization is a technique, which allows to
share a single physical demand of a resource
or an application among multiple customers
and organizations.
Virtualization is the "creation of a virtual
(rather than actual) version of Server,
Desktop, Storage device, Operating system or
network resources".
Virtualization is commonly hypervisor-based. The hypervisor (In hypervisor process the time
required to access and terminate server is reduced through hardware virtualization) isolates
operating systems and applications from the underlying computer hardware so that the host
machine can run multiple virtual machines.
